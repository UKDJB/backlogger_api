Your unified logical data structure introduces a hierarchical relationship among work items. This structure clarifies ownership and dependencies, ensuring consistency across projects.

Given this, the "Summary of Minimum Work Item Types by Level" should align with the Epic-based hierarchy while maintaining simplicity at different experience levels.

Starter (Essential Work Items)
    For teams new to Kanban, work items focus on basic execution within the Epic structure.

    Epic
    User Story – Defines an end-user requirement.
    Task – A specific unit of work needed to complete a story.
    Bug – Tracks defects or issues that need fixing.

    Why? This keeps the structure lightweight while ensuring planned work (User Story & Task) and unplanned work (Bug) are covered.

Pro (Intermediate Work Items)
    For teams needing better work categorization, work items support feature planning and technical health.

    Epic
    User Story
    Task
    Bug
    Technical Debt – Addresses past shortcuts or refactoring needs.
    Improvement – Enhancements to existing functionality.
    Spike – Research or exploration work before implementation.
    Test – Work related to validation and quality assurance.

    Why? Adds testing, technical debt, and research items, ensuring a more structured product development approach.

Business (Advanced Work Items)
    For large-scale teams, this level introduces customer interaction, defect tracking, and process-driven changes.

    Epic
    User Story
    Task
    Bug
    Technical Debt
    Improvement
    Spike
    Test
    Defect – Quality issues reported during testing.
    Support Ticket – Customer-reported issues requiring attention.
    Change Request – Requested modification to an existing feature.

    Why? The Business level differentiates between internal defects (Defect), external issues (Support Ticket), and process-driven modifications (Change Request)—ensuring complete tracking of work from development to deployment.
